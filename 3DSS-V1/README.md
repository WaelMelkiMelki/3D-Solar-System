3DSS-V1 Summary The 3DSS-V1 folder contains the original implementation of the 3D Solar System simulation, developed using Three.js and structured around a monolithic architecture. It includes modular subfolders for planets, moons, asteroids, textures, materials, and interaction logic, alongside core scripts like main.js, animate.js, and configuration files. This version served as a foundational prototype, demonstrating orbital motion, visual realism, and interactive features. While functionally complete, it has been archived to make way for 3DSS-V2, which introduces a cleaner ES module architecture and improved maintainability.
