# 3DSS-V2 — Modular 3D Solar System Simulation 🌌

This repository contains **3DSS-V2**, the second version of the 3D Solar System simulation.  
It is a complete refactor of `3DSS-V1`, rebuilt with a clean **ES module architecture** and modern development practices using **Vite**.  
The goal of this version is to improve scalability, maintainability, and performance while keeping the simulation interactive and visually engaging.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ES module-based architecture for modularity and clarity
- Realistic orbital motion and planetary rendering
- Dedicated modules for planets, moons, asteroids, textures, and interactions
- Vite-powered development environment for fast builds and hot reload
- Improved separation of concerns and cleaner project structure
- Ready for future enhancements and scalability
